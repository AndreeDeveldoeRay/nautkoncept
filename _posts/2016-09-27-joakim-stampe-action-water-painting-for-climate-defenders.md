This is an improvised tribute to the 30 activists and journalists who were brutally seized by Russian security forces in the Barents Sea. At the time of Joakim Stampe's performance, these climate defenders were facing long sentences in Russia for "hooliganism" -- for peacefully trying to call attention to the mindless oil drilling in the Arctic.
