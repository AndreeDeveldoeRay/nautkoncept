  The G2 Winter Flight Suit was developed in close collaboration with aircrews
  in Greenland and northern Norway. The mission was to come up with a concept
  that would be blizzard proof, yet flush enough to avoid the stiffness that
  tend to obscure vision and obstruct arm/wrist movements. The end result is a
  perfect combination of ultra thin insulating layers inspired by top shelf
  alpine wear. Snow-gaiters and ultra comfortable cuffs keeps the good stuff in
  and the bad stuff out. Ergonomic kneepads included.
