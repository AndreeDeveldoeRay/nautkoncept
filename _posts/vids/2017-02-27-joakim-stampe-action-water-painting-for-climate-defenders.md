  This is an improvised tribute to the 30 activists and journalists who were
  brutally seized by Russian security forces in the Barents Sea. At the time of
  Joakim Stampe's performance, these climate defenders were facing long
  sentences in Russia for "hooliganism" -- for peacefully trying to call
  attention to the mindless oil drilling in the Arctic.
